Description: The package "smart" provides a general framework for
        analyzing (including estimation, feature selection and
        prediction) and visualize big data. It integrates several
        novel, efficient and robust data analysis tools, including
        Transelliptical Component Analysis (TCA), Transelliptical
        Correlation Estimation (TCE) and Group Nearest Shrunken
        Centroids (gnsc). We target on high dimensional data
        analysis(usually d >> n), and exploit compuationally
        efficiently approaches. Results are organized to be visulaized
        properly for users.
